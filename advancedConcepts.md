 ## Automating repetitive tasks
  
The ability to automate repetitive tasks is the whole reason we use computers in the first place! There are a number of functions built into R that will allow us to repeat an operation over and over again. There are three fundamental units of repetition in R and computer science: ````repeat( )````, ````while( )````, and ````for( )````. 

Luckily, anything that can be achieved with ````repeat( )```` or ````while( )```` can also be achieved with````for( )````, so you only need to learn one of three. Congrats!
